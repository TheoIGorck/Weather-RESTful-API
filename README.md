# Weather-RESTful-API
Project created for learning about RESTful APIs in Unity.

The project uses two APIs, one for geolocation and OpenWeatherAPI. If you would like to test it you'll need an OpenWeatherAPI Key. You can get the key for free on OpenWeatherAPI website, but it have a limit of calls per day. Then you can then set the key through the inspector of the "WeatherGetter" script. I was making requests every 10 minutes.

This was inspired by polymars youtube video
